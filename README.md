# AutoCoder
This project will help you gain hands-on experience with GitHub Actions, the GitHub API, Bash scripting, and integrating third-party services like OpenAI's ChatGPT. You will also learn about workflow automation, security considerations, and the power of integrating AI in DevOps practices.

Dive into the cutting-edge intersection of DevOps and AI with AutoCoder. This project guides you to build a reusable GitHub Action that leverages Generative AI to auto-generate code. You will create workflows, interact with OpenAI using scripts, enforce security standards, and eventually convert your project to a reusable GitHub Action to share with others or show off in your portfolio.
